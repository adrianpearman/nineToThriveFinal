            ROI of Wellness in the Workplace
          </h2>
          <div class="photoOnPage">
            <img src="photos/hero2.jpeg" alt="" class="photoOnPage">
          </div>
          <p class="mainText">It’s no surprise that top employers like <a href="">Google,</a> <a href="https://greatist.com/happiness/healthy-companies-google"target="_blank">Google,</a><a href="https://hbr.org/2015/12/why-google-target-and-general-mills-are-investing-in-mindfulness"target="_blank">Target, Intel and General Mills </a>are investing in health-related perks for their staff- it pays</p>

          <h3>Attract Top Talent</h3>

          <p class='mainText'>Being an employer of choice helps attract and retain the best talent. <a href="">75% Of Canada’s Top 100 Employers </a>agree that one of the most important reasons for implementing a wellness program is to improve their corporate reputation.</p>

          <p class='mainText'>We’re living in a market where there are more jobs than candidates in many industries. Recruiters and Hiring Managers are facing an increasingly demanding and competitive talent market.</p>

          <p class='mainText'>Standing out as a brand of choice will help you to cut through the noise and capture the attention of top talent. </p>

          <p class='mainText'>Plus, job perks can offset the benefits package for candidates- according to the <a href="https://www.servomax.com/files/uploads/productivite/Conference%20Board.pdf"target="_blank">Conference Board of Canada,</a> 48% of employees  would prefer to have a health benefit plan than an extra 20,000 a year in cash.</p>

          <h3>Reduce Turnover </h3>
          <img src="/photos/team fist pump.jpg" alt="Reduce Turnover" class="photoOnPage">
          <p class='mainText'>The <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/CostofTurnover.pdf"target="_blank">Center for America Progress </a> reported that the cost of losing an employee can cost anywhere up to 213% of the salary for a highly trained position. Plus you need to think <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-kantor/high-turnover-costs-way-more-than-you-think_b_9197238.html"target="_blank"> about the expenses of on-boarding and training,</a> advertising for the position and any recruitment fees that add up. That means that if the average salary for an employee is 50,000, you’re losing up to $106,500 when all is said and done. </p>

          <p class='mainText'>Yet, these cost can be minimized by employers investing in their staff’s well-being. Investing in a <a href="https://www.servomax.com/files/uploads/productivite/Conference%20Board.pdf" target="_blank">few perks could reduce your turnover costs by 40% </a>. Of that $106,500 you’re losing to turn over, you could save $42,600. Not chump change. </p>

          <h3>Increase Productivity & Customer Satisfaction </h3>
          <img src="photos/happy at work.jpg" alt="Increase Productivity" class="photoOnPage">
          <p class='mainText'>By investing in health related perks, employers are not only able to retain top talent, but increase their productivity and overall customer satisfaction.</p>

          <p class='mainText'>The Canadian Institute of Stress (<a href="https://www.wsps.ca/WSPS/media/Site/Resources/Downloads/BusinessCaseHW_Final.pdf?ext=.pdf"target="_blank">Bell Canada Operator Services research</a>) found that stress control programs resulted in a 7% improvement in productivity and 13% improvement in service quality.</p>

          <p class='mainText'>Plus, <a href="https://www.wsps.ca/WSPS/media/Site/Resources/Downloads/BusinessCaseHW_Final.pdf?ext=.pdf"target="_blank"> Health and Safety Ontario’s study </a>reported that for every 5-unit increase in employee satisfaction in one quarter, there is a 1.3 unit increase in customer satisfaction in the next quarter and a 0.5 unit increase in revenue (above national average).</p>

          <h3>The Cost of Inaction</h3>
          <img src="/photos/packagesPhotos/cost of inaction.jpg" alt="Cost of Inaction" class="photoOnPage">
          <p class='mainText'>Although the benefits of standing out as an employer of choice and reducing your turnover rates might not be a top priority, the cost of not improving the health of your workforce might sway that. </p>

          <p class='mainText'>Stress-related absences cost Canadian employers about <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75-001-x/00603/6533-eng.html"target="_blank"> $3.5 B per year</a>. Lifestyle is a contributor to this cost. <a href="https://www.wsps.ca/WSPS/media/Site/Resources/Downloads/BusinessCaseHW_Final.pdf?ext=.pdf" target="_blank"> Health and Safety Ontario </a> found that employees with lifestyle risk factors (sedentary, overweight, smoker, high alcohol intake) are absent 50% more than those without and cost the business 2-3 times more in health care costs. </p>

          <p class='mainText'>Also when’s the last time you looked at what you’re spending in health benefit claims? You might be surprised to see what you are spending on a workforce with higher than average health risks, and this is only increasing. A <a href="http://www.occ.ca/Publications/Cost-Trends-in-Health-Benefits-Report.pdf"target="_blank">Mercer Report</a> predicts that well before 2019 drug costs will soar by 2.5 to 3 times their current levels or between 3% and 5% of payroll.</p>

          <p class='mainText'>There is a lot to be gained by investing in health related perks for your staff. Again no surprise that top employers and performing companies have already made this shift. </p>
